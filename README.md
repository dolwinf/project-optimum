The idea behind this project was to create a platform where users can exchange or sell items ranging from simple goods to cars etc. This is a full stack application that uses jQuery in the frontend and NodeJS along with a SQL ORM in the backend. It uses JWT web tokens for authentication and Bcrypt for hashing passwords.

This application is live and is deployed to: https://immense-cliffs-87369.herokuapp.com/
